A mobile app called "StayHard" that gives users aggressive motivation to complete their daily tasks.
The app should have a bold, sarcastic personality with glitchy, punchy, no-excuses vibes.
The primary flow includes onboarding, a voice-to-task transcription home screen, recurring 30-minute reminders, and a user profile/settings page for tone adjustment.
Use dark themes with neon highlights. Think rebellious, intense, and slightly funny—but with purpose.
